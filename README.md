# Description
If you got a binary file that contains Ips u can use this. It was coded with the intention to get me into coding and to play on the LiveOverflow Minecraft Server :) . U can use the ips_to_test file to test the script. I don't wanted to use masscan by myself to get the potential Ips so I used https://github.com/mat-1/minecraft-scans. It was very helpful.
